# Where is Waldo - PatternSearching

"Where is Waldo" is a program coded in java during my first year of Computer Science BCs at EPFL. The goal of this project was to be able to find a pattern on an image using two differents methods : Distance searching and Similarity searching. To make it more confortable and general, we make sure that you can use this program with any pattern and image and not juste with ours.
This project was supervised by Pr. Jamila Sam in the context of the course : Introduction to Programation in JAVA.

## Getting Started

To use this program you just need to run the class "frogram" from the package "/src". Then follow the instruction (fill the pattern, the background and the method of searching that you want use).

### Prerequisites

There is no needeed installation. Excepte Java (1.8 or more) and a compilator of your choice (Eclipse for us).

//TO DO : A .jar runnable file to directly use the programm

### Installing

1st : Download/clone the repository on you computer. 
2nd : Open the file using a IDE (Eclipse for us, but other should work as intelliJ etc...)
3nd : Run the file .programm and let you guide.

## Running the tests

To run tests use the the class `Main` (As it was our first project in Programmation we didn't already know how to use JUnit test)

### Break down into end to end tests

Test were checking the different step of our method and also compare them. You could see that the Distance search method doesn't work with certain type of image (to dark, to light ...).

## Built With

* [eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) -  Integrated development environment (IDE)

## Contributing

No contribution directly possible. But if you have any idea/suggestion don't hesitate to send me a message. Remember that this was our first project in programation so the style is not good, and complexity too. But the purpose of this was more to learn how us Eclipse correctly and also developping easy but usful algotithms in the fields of image processing.
