Marc Watine and me did this project in 1st year of Computer Science BCs at EPFL. 
The goal was to find Waldo in an image. We can also applied this technique to find any pattern in a image.
To be a able to find a pattern in a image we define two different Algorithm : 
The first one : *DistanceBasedSearch*. Then we upgrade our approach by using an other algorithm : *SimilarityBasedSearch*.
To launch this program and test it with you own image juste launch the class "Program".
